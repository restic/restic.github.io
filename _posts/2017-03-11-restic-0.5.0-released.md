title: "restic 0.5.0 released"
---

We've just released [restic 0.5.0](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.5.0). 

This release contains (among many bug fixes) several improvements to the user interface:

 * more progress bars
 * consistent filtering for tags, hostname, or path
 * a new command tag which allows modifying tags of existing snapshots

Since we've internally started using the new `context` package, Go 1.7 is now
required for compiling restic. Running `build.go` will check this for you. The
released binaries have been compiled with Go 1.8.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!
