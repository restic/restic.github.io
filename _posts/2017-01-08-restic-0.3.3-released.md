title: "restic 0.3.3 released, Debian package"
---

We've released another minor version: [restic 0.3.3](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.3.3).
As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!

Recently, several people [worked together](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/355) to create and upload an official Debian package for restic.
A few days ago on 2 January 2017, that package entered the `testing` distribution, so restic will be part of the next Debian stable release!
