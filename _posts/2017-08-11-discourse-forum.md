We've noticed that there are [many questions raised as issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aquestion) on GitHub, so we've installed a Discourse forum at [https://forum.restic.net](https://forum.restic.net)! For now, this is an experiment to see if a forum is better suited to answer questions. We'll see how that goes.

Please let us know any feedback you have (in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net), obviously)!
