We've just released [restic 0.7.3](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.7.3) to correct a bug with the Google Cloud Storage and Azure backends. When `restic prune` or `restic rebuild-index` was run, not all files stored in these backends were considered.

For downloading the code, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.7.3).
As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!

The binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).


Important Changes in 0.7.3
==========================

 * For large backups stored in Google Cloud Storage, the `prune` command fails because listing only returns the first 1000 files. This has been corrected, no data is lost in the process. In addition, a plausibility check was added to `prune`.
