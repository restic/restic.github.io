If you're reading this, you've found your way to the restic development blog,
awesome! Let me welcome you on behalf of the whole development team.

In this blog we'll publish articles that explain the foundation techniques that
restic is built upon and will give some insights into what's happening on the
development side of restic. Once restic is widely in use, we'll probably shift
the focus a bit towards the user perspective of backups and present tips and
tricks for using restic more efficiently.

But for now, stay tuned for explanations of the base techniques!
