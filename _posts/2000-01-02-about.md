## Restic is a program that does backups right.

### The design goals are:

- **Easy:** Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you are
  tempted to skip it.  Restic should be easy to configure and use, so that in
  the unlikely event of a data loss you can just restore it. Likewise,
  restoring data should not be complicated.
- **Fast:** Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your
  network or harddisk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.
  Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring backups should only
  transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so that
  this process is also fast.
- **Verifiable:** Much more important than backup is restore, so restic enables
  you to easily verify that all data can be restored.
- **Secure:** Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and integrity
  of your data. The location the backup data is stored is assumed not to be a
  trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where others like system
  administrators are able to access your backups). Restic is built to secure
  your data against such attackers.
- **Efficient:** With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only take
  the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate data should be
  de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage backend to save
  precious backup space.
